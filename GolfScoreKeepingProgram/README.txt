Hello.

This is just a quick description and tutorial for the program.
This program is designed to help golfers keep track of their score.  The program begins by asking the user if they have a par file.  This par file should be a txt file with the par of each hole listed in a column with one number per line.  If the user answers with a 'y' then the program will prompt the user for the file name. I have attached a demo file named "coursePar.txt" that you can use.  After the user has inputted the file or chosen not to, the user will be shown a menu.  The user can input/change a score, check their score, or end their round.

When the user chooses to input a score, the program asks which hole.  Then the score for the hole.  Where the drive landed (Many golfers like to keep track of where their drive landed as a statistic to help them improve).  And how many putts they took (This again is another stat that golfers like to keep track of).

At the end when the user chooses to end the round it asks the user if they want a report of the round.  If they do then a file named roundReport is exported which shows what they check score feature would show.

Thank! And I hope you enjoy the program.
