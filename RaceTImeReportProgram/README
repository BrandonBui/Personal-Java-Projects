These three classes are designed to be used together.  The main driver creates objects of the Race and RaceReport classes.  The program is designed to prompt the user for 3 race times in any order.  The program will then sort the times into ascending order with the fastest being first and slowest being third.  The program will tell the user if there are any ties, the range, and the average time.
